CASE STUDY
1. The Brief
Valve is an entertainment software and technology company founded in
1996. In addition to creating several of the world’s most award-winning
games, Valve has also developed several leading-edge technologies, such
as Source® game engine and Steam®, the premier online gaming
platform.
Steam is Valve’s direct pipeline to customers. It began as a little sleeper
project—a handy tool to update Counter-Strike—and morphed quickly
into the world's largest online gaming platform. Steam guarantees instant
access to more than 1,800 game titles and connects its 35 million active
users to each other—including us. Through Steam, fans can easily
purchase, play, share, modify and build communities around Valve
products as well as titles from other independent game studios. Steam is
already available in 237 countries and 21 different languages.

2.The Problem
Due to the rising number of games on different platform (Phone, Nintendo,
PS, Xbox), the number of Steam concurrent users has significantly
decreased. Thus, Valve Corporation needs a solution (an improvement or a
new feature for the current Steam Platform) to regain back their users.

3. The Scope
Therefore, Valve Corporation decided to hire a System Analyst (who is you!)
to tackle the problem by providing three (3) deliverables, which are:
1. A root cause analysis of the problem.
2. An IT solution to solve the problem.
3. The challenge (gap) for Valve in implementing the IT solution.
